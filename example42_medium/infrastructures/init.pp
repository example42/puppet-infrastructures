# Here you find some example Puppet infrastructures templates.

# There can be many approaches:
# - Nodes are defined in an inheritance tree (basenode -> zones -> node),
# with different custom "zones" used to group nodes according to custom logic.

# The files included in infrastructures/ are different examples.

# This file is necessary in EVERY CASES (it defines Puppet's default basenode)
basenode.pp

# An example of Development / Staging / Production Infrastructure  

# CHANGE EXAMPLE VARIABLES!
# Move or redefine variables accounding to a single inheritance tree (Ex: yournode inherits prod inherits basenode)
# Here zones are generally related to different networks / host position

# Example Development / Staging / Production Infrastructure
