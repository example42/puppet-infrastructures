# HOW TO USE THE MAILSCANNER TOASTER

# Follow instructions in toasters/README for installation of Puppet and git on
# different operating systems.

##################################################################
### DOWNLOAD, CUSTOMIZE AND USE THE TOASTER
### (Procedure is the same on different OS) 
##################################################################

# Download via git Example42 puppet modules
git clone git://www.example42.com/example42modules /etc/puppet/modules
git clone git://www.example42.com/example42infrastructures /etc/puppet/manifests

# Edit the variables in toasters/mailscanner/init.pp (at least $postfix_mynetworks)
# vi /etc/puppet/manifests/toasters/mailscanner/init.pp

# Run Puppet on the mailscanner/init.pp manifest and have a cup of coffee
# This step will last at least half an hour, and it depends also on your Internet access speed:
# Various packages are installed and all the MailScanner RPMS are downloaded and built.
# Don't worry if the procedure seems to stuck in some moments.
# In doubt, check out from another session what's happening on your system.
puppet -v /etc/puppet/manifests/toasters/mailscanner/init.pp

# You may need to re-run Puppet if there have been dependencies issues.
# You can/should do this as many times as you want, until nothing new happens.
puppet -v /etc/puppet/manifests/toasters/mailscanner/init.pp

# If you modify manually the files managed by Puppet ( ie: /etc/postfix/main.cf )
# DO NOT run Puppet anymore, as it re-establishes the system status (packages, configs...)
# that has been defined in its modules and manifests.
# So, you may decide to remove Puppet from your system and keep on managing it manually:
# rpm -e puppet # (On RedHat/Centos)
# apt-get remove puppet # (On Debian/Ubuntu)
