# INTRODUCTION 
# /etc/manifest/site.pp is the first file that, by default, the PuppetMaster
# loads if you don't use an ENC.
#
# Here you find a sample layout of a Puppet infrastructure based on the Example42 modules
# We import explicitely various manifests classes placed in /etc/manifests/
# and modules that can't be autoloaded from your modulepath ( /etc/puppet/modules )

# GENERAL IMPORTS AND RESOURCE DEFAULTS
# Example42 common module (contains defines used by other modules that can't autoload)
# This is kept for backwards compatibility with some modules
import "common"

# This is the module that contains our customizations:
# - Our custom roles and baselines, included by the nodes
#Â - Our custom classes, autoloaded in $myproject is set to lab42
# - Our templates and configuration files
import "example42" 

# General settings for standard types
Exec { path => "/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin" }

# TOP SCOPE VARIABLES
# Here are valuated all the variables you may want to use to affect module's behaviour
