### DOWNLOAD, CUSTOMIZE AND USE THE TOASTER
### (Procedure is the same on different OS) 
##################################################################

# Download via git Example42 puppet modules
git clone git://www.example42.com/example42modules /etc/puppet/modules
git clone git://www.example42.com/example42infrastructures /etc/puppet/manifests

# Edit eventually the variables in the toaster you want. 

# Run Puppet on the selected toaster
# IE: puppet -v /etc/puppet/manifests/toasters/oracle/oracle.pp

# You may need to re-run Puppet if there have been dependencies issues.
# You can/should do this as many times as you want, until nothing new happens.

# If you modify manually the files managed by Puppet 
# DO NOT run Puppet anymore, as it re-establishes the system status (packages, configs...)
# that has been defined in its modules and manifests.
# So, you may decide to remove Puppet from your system and keep on managing it manually:
# rpm -e puppet # (On RedHat/Centos)
# apt-get remove puppet # (On Debian/Ubuntu)
