# PUPPET MASTER SETUP - HOW TO USE

# Follow instructions in toasters/README for installation of Puppet and git on your system.

# Then download via git Example42 puppet modules
git clone git://www.example42.com/example42modules /etc/puppet/modules
git clone git://www.example42.com/example42infrastructures /etc/puppet/manifests

# Edit eventually the variables and the classes to include in puppet/init.pp
# vi /etc/puppet/manifests/toasters/puppet/init.pp

# Run Puppet on puppet/init.pp
puppet -v /etc/puppet/manifests/toasters/puppet/init.pp

# You may need to re-run Puppet if there have been dependencies issues.
# You can/should do this as many times as you want, until nothing new happens.
puppet -v /etc/puppet/manifests/toasters/puppet/init.pp
