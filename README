EXAMPLE 42 PUPPET INFRASTRUCTURES

Here you can find some sample Puppet infrastructures that can be seen as an idea
of how you can organize your Puppet nodes.

Note that you have 2 ways to define nodes in Puppet:
- Via Puppet manifests, using the "node" definitions
- Via an External Node Tool, such as Dashboard or Foreman, where you have a GUI 
  that helps in setting nodes and their variables.

The general logic is that for each node you have to set variables (that affects its
classes behaviour) and include classes (that generally are placed in omonimous modules).

If you choose the first approach (which is the default) you might find useful 
the infrastructures provided here.
Note that in this case, when no external module tool is used, the first module
that the PuppetMaster checks is  /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
from here you can import all the additions files you want.

There are different sample layouts:
example42_small - Used for small setups. It's included by default in site.pp
example42_medium - A sample layout for medium sized setups (up to few hundreds of nodes)
toasters - Examples of "single-shot" setups that can be used to quickly fire-up an appliance.

NOTE: This is a work in progress, use it only as a reference.
